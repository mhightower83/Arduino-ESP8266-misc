# Arduino ~IDE Tweaks~ ESP8266 Misc
**On the Internet everything is always changing. So the likely hood that something here will be out of date is high.
Everything changes faster than I can keep up.**

Some ESP8266 centric tweaks for the Arduino IDE setup that I find useful. The methods used here in principle should have applications with other 3rd Party *Board Manager* selections.

The scope pf this WiKi has been expanded to also include more misc ESP8266 issues.
