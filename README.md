# Arduino ~IDE Tweaks~ ESP8266 Misc
**On the Internet everything is always changing. So the likely hood that something here will be out of date is high.
Everything changes faster than I can keep up.**

Some ESP8266 centric tweaks for the Arduino IDE setup that I find useful. The methods used here in principle should have applications with other 3rd Party *Board Manager* selections.

This project has transistion into more of a Wiki collection of my hardware and software notes on the ESP8266.
This includes many links to expaned subject matter.
